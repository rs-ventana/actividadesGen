/**
 * Antipodal Average
 * Given an array, return a shorter array following these steps:
 * - Split the array into two equal parts*. If unequal, remove the middle element to obtain two equal arrays.
 * - Sum each number of the first part with the inverse numbers of the second part.
 * - Divide each number of the resulting array by 2.
 * 
 * Example:
 * - For the array `[1,2,3,5,22,6]`, the result should be `[3.5, 12, 4]`.
